# Introduction to linear algebra 
### 1. For this course students are required to read the module before each forthcoming lecture 
### 2. Broader context of daily topic
### 3. Students work on problems and instructors moves around to and also coach the student one-on-one
### 4. After the students and successfully solved the problem instructor may refocus the class by providing an explanation or obtaining explanation from students. (This is measure to make sure the point is not missed)

## Conceptual lean: The core exercises are geared toward introducing the concepts and not computation

* Strategy: Figure out what the point to the day's lesson is and brainstorm some examples that would illustrate that point
* Work through core exercise
* Reflect on how each core exercises addresses the day's goals. Compare with the examples that you brainstormed. Prepare follow up questions that you can use in class to test for understanding.
* Schedule: Timestamp next to CORE exercise to indicate starting minute that I intend to start each exercise. Triage(deciding the priority according to understanding of the content whehter it is foundational or not)Foundational should get highest priority.
* Exercises are build on each other 
* 50 minutes for two three exercises depending upon difficulty.
# MODULE 1
■ The basics of sets and set-builder notation.
■ The definition of vectors and how they relate to points.
■ Column vector notation and to how represent vectors in drawings.
■ How to compute linear combinations of vectors and use systems of linear equations to answer questions about linear combinations of vectors.
# _Vector addition | Scalar Multiplication are the two fundamental operations_ 

### [Vectors explained youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLYqCO-vUcHToenNSAgHetS5hTzRcQpZ_H)
* Vectors from three different perspective
* First number tells you the direction to move on x axis with positive and negative accordingly 
* Second number tells you direction to move on y axis with positive and negative signs
* Every pair of number gives you only one and one vector ->
* Scaling vectors is multiplying the -> or effect on vectors upon multiplying
* 
# SETS: 
* We write sets in {and} and list the objects inside : {1,2,3} which could be read out loud like the set containing the elements 1,2 and 3.
* ∈ i used to specify that something is an element of as set. 3 ∈ {1,2,3} 4 ∈/ {1,2,3}.
* It is traditional to use capital letter A={} to name sets.
